# Web-Qquery-Editor
Hi, this is my final result.
Guidance:

1) After coming at the main page select "Query Builder" from navbar.
2) At query builder you can choose your options.
3) After selecting options click button save "querry into xml".
4) After that click button "Run query to see the result"


P.S. The generated xml file is saved into /Models/Where.xml
The main controller is QueryController, there are all the functionalities of the service.
Actually because of some problems in view a script isn't working and beacuse of it onlt 2 rows of clauses are active.
